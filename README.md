# Pic-Led-Controller

Project for personal training, the task is to manage a led array of w2812b leds only using a pic 16f690.

Because of very strick and borderline requirements in timing i chose to program the whole program in assembler, both for my own personal experience and gaining more in depth knowledge in the matter especifically this micro-controller.

After that was done, this project was reused for a competition, in which i used the base project of the display to make it play tetris, it was really fun making it all work. It is compleatly functional as far as i could test it, all gameplay works without a hitch, is just missing some nice to have features like being able to change colors or having multiple colors being displayed at once.

So for now it remains as is, hope anyone finds this interesting.
